# Profile Hub Summary

The Profile Hub is the always-on navigation banner used across inQ Social. Our Next.js port recreates it as a client-side component that floats at the top-right, combines user identity, quick actions, stats, and a placeholder AI assistant. The panel remembers theme + scale via local storage, supports neon/minimal/cyber looks, and exposes navigation tiles, action buttons, and a mock chat stream while leaving authentication hooks for later wiring.
